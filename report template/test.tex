\section*{Overview}

We are required to fit the MF96 tyre model coefficients on a data-set of measured tyre forces for a  F-SAE tyre.
The data-set is provided by the Calspan Tire Research Facility (TIRF). The tyre chosen in our case was the Hoosier 18.0 x 6.0 - 10 R25B.
The reference frame used in the data-set is the ISO reference frame.

\section*{Pure Lateral Force}

We need to fit the pure condition parameters using the nominal load of $F_z = F_{z\text{\:nom}} = 220$[N] and zeros camber.

Doing this using the Matlab \verb|fmincon| function we obtain the following plot:
